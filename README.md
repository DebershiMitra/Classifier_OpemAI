# Classifier_OpemAI
This code snippet is part of a Python script designed to classify user requests into specific categories using the OpenAI API.
Let's break down the components and functionality:

# Imports:
from openai import OpenAI: Importing the OpenAI class from the openai module.
import json: Importing the json module for JSON manipulation.
import os: Importing the os module for interacting with the operating system.
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv: Importing load_dotenv and find_dotenv functions from the dotenv module, which is used for loading environment variables from a .env file.

# Loading Environment Variables:
load_dotenv(find_dotenv()): Loading environment variables from a .env file, if present

# API Key Retrieval:
os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"): Retrieving the OpenAI API key from environment variables.
OpenAI Client Initialization:
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")): Creating an instance of the OpenAI class with the API key.

# Function Definition:

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-4-turbo"): Defining a function get_completion that takes a prompt and an optional model parameter and returns the completion generated by the OpenAI API.

# User Input:
user_request = input("Enter the prompt: "): Prompting the user to enter a request.

# Test Function:
def test(user_request): Defining a function test that takes a user request as input.
Inside the test function, a prompt is constructed based on the user's request, and the get_completion function is called to generate a completion using the OpenAI API.
The completion response is parsed from JSON format, and the intent is extracted.
The intent is then classified into one of four categories: Search Web, Send Email, Query Document, or Butler Query based on keywords present in the response.
The function returns the classified intent.

# Execution:
test(user_request): Calling the test function with the user's input request to classify the intent.

# The script primarily revolves around generating completions for user prompts using the OpenAI API and classifying the intent of those prompts into predefined categories. It's an example of using natural language processing for intent classification.
